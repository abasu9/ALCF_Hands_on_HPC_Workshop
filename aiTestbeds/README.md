# Hands-On with AI Testbeds at ALCF 

Scientific applications are increasingly adopting Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to advance science. There are specialized hardware accelerators designed and built to efficiently run AI applications. With the diverse hardware and software stacks of these systems, it is challenging to comprehend their capabilities, programming approaches, and measure performance. 

We present an overview of novel AI accelerators namely, SambaNova, Graphcore and Cerebras. We present steps on how to program these systems by porting deep learning models with any refactoring of codes implemented in standard DL framework implementations, compiling and running on the accelerator hardware. Hands-on session on SambaNova, Graphcore, and Cerebras provides the attendees with an understanding of the key capabilities of emerging AI accelerators and their performance implications for scientific applications.
