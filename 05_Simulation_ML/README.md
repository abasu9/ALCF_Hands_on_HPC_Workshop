Today, we're learning about coupling simulations and machine learning.

1. First, [here](Background.md) we will talk about why we would want to couple simulations & ML and describe ways to do it.
2. Then, [here](HandsOn.md) we will work through our hands-on example with one way to couple Python and C++. (written by Romit Maulik)
3. Finally, we will learn about SmartSim. 

Bonus:
For extra tips for using the Python and Numpy C APIs, check out [this page](Tips.md).
