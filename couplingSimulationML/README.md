# Combining HPC Simulations with AI/ML

Led by Saumil Patel and Riccardo Balin from ALCF, assisted by Bethany Lusch and Filippo Simini. 

Today, we're learning about coupling simulations and machine learning.

1. First, [here](Background.md) we will talk about why we would want to couple simulations & ML and describe ways to do it.
2. Then, [here](ML_PythonC++_Embedding/README.md) we will work through our hands-on example with one way to couple Python and C++. (written by Romit Maulik & Saumil Patel)
3. Finally, we will learn about SmartSim and how to use it [here](SmartSim/README.md). 

Bonus:
For extra tips for using the Python and Numpy C APIs, check out [this page](Tips.md).
