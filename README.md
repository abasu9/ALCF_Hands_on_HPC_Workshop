# ALCF: Simulation, Data, and Learning Workshop
### October 4 - 6, 2022
### Agenda: https://www.alcf.anl.gov/events/2022-alcf-simulation-data-and-learning-workshop

The ALCF regularly hosts a simulation, data, and learning workshop to help users scale their applications. We are currently updating the content for the 2022 agenda.

### The repo is divided by the workshop sessions:
Day 1 
  * [Programming Models](programmingModels)

Day 2
   * [Distributed Deep Learning](distributedDeepLearning)
   * [Building Data Pipelines](dataPipelines)
   * [Hyperparameter Management](hyperparameterManagement)
   * [Profiling Deep Learning](profilingDeepLearning)

Day 3
   * [Integrating Al and Simulations](couplingSimulationML)

Plus bonus material that we will not cover during the workshop:
   * [Supplementary machine learning materials](extraMachineLearningMaterials)
