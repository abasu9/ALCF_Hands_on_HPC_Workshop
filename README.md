# ALCF: Simulation, Data, and Learning Workshop
### October 4 - 6, 2022
### Agenda: https://www.alcf.anl.gov/events/2022-alcf-simulation-data-and-learning-workshop

The ALCF regularly hosts a simulation, data, and learning workshop to help users scale their applications. This workshop focuses on capabilities at scale. We are currently updating the content for the 2022 agenda.

### The repo is divided by the workshop sessions:
   * [Introductory material (review on your own prior to workshop)](00_pre_workshop_materials)
   * [Distributed Deep Learning](01_distributedDeepLearning)
   * [Building Effective Data Pipelines for CPU/GPU systems](02_dataPipelines)
   * [Hyperparameter Optimization using DeepHyper on ALCF Systems](03_distributedHyperOpt)
   * [Profiling Deep Learning applications](04_profilingDeepLearning)
   * [Integrating inference in to simulation](05_Simulation_ML)
