# ALCF Hands-on HPC Workshop
### October 10 - 12, 2023
### Agenda: https://www.alcf.anl.gov/events/alcf-hands-hpc-workshop

The ALCF is hosting an in-person Hands-on HPC Workshop on October 10-12, 2023, at the TCS Conference Center at Argonne National Laboratory.

The workshop will provide an opportunity for hands-on time on Polaris and AI Testbeds focusing on porting applications to heterogeneous architectures (CPU + GPU), improving code performance, and exploring AI/ML applications development on ALCF systems.

### The repo is divided by the workshop sessions:
Day 1 
  * [Programming Models](programmingModels)

Day 2
   * [Python, Jupyter Notebooks & Containers](python_notebook_containers)
   * [Learning Frameworks & Distributed Deep Learning](learningFrameworks)
   * [LLM on Polaris](llm)
   * [AI Testbeds](aiTestbeds)
   * [Integrating Al and Simulations](couplingSimulationML)
   * [Tools (NVIDIA, Intel, TAU & HPC-Toolkit](tools)

Day 3
   * [Visualization, I/O & File System] (visualization_io)
   * [File System & Sharing](fs_sharing)
   * [Workflows](workflows)

Plus bonus material that we will not cover during the workshop:
   * [Supplementary machine learning materials](extraMachineLearningMaterials)
